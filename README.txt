Approach:

hello-py: I created a variable named name and assigned it the value "Duke". On the second line, I used the print function to display the message "Hello, Duke!" by concatenating the string "Hello, " with the variable name and the string "!" using the + operator.

due_date-py: I defined separate variables for month, day, year, hours, minutes, and seconds, assigning each variable a specific value. Then, I used the print function to display the combined information by concatenating all the variables with the + operator to form a single string. This allowed the program to display the date and time information.
